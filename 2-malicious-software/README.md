# In-Class Kaggle Competitions

## Harvard CS181 Machine Learning - Spring 2016

**[Competition 2](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cs181-s16-classifying-malicious-software):** **Classifying Malicious Software**

For this project we used machine learning methods to identify classes of malware (or the lack of malware) in executable files. Our analysis was based on XML logs of the executablesâ€™ execution histories, which we parsed in order to create features associated with particular malware classes.

At the time of submission, we had uploaded 18 different sets of predictions to Kaggle and achieved a best categorization accuracy of 84%, which put us in first place on the leaderboard. Following release of the withheld final test data (three days later), we achieved a categorization accuracy of 82% and a ranking of 5/80 on the leaderboard. Our best results were achieved using a tuned random forest classifier and features based on counts of sequences of system calls.
