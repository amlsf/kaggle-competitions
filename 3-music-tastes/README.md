# In-Class Kaggle Competitions

## Harvard CS181 Machine Learning - Spring 2016

**[Competition 3](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/cs181-s16-practical-3-predicting-music-tastes):** **Predicting Music Tastes**

For this project we used machine learning methods to predict the number of times different users will listen to tracks by different artists over a given time horizon. Our analysis was based on: basic demographic attribute that were provided for most of the 233K users, attributes for the 2K artists that were scraped from MusicBrainz1 and Wikipedia, and a training set of the historical number of plays of 4.1M user-artist pairs.

At the time of submission, we had uploaded 12 different sets of predictions to Kaggle and achieved a best mean absolute error (MAE) of 137.50, which put us above the user median base- line. Though we tried a number of more sophisticated modeling techniques, our best results were achieved by adjusting the user median baseline to include a small amount of artist bias.
